## Design Process

### Layout Testing with print outs

With [KLE](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) I came up with a base layout (white):

As I was unsure about the top & bottom design, I included multiple variants. The pcb version should also include support for the light gray variant (PCB A variant), which also allows to use the same pcb for left & right.

More images can be seen in [layouts/](layout/readme.md)
